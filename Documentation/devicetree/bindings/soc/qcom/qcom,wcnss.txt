Qualcomm WCNSS Binding

This binding describes the Qualcomm WCNSS hardware. It consists of control
block and a BT, WiFi and FM radio block, all useing SMD as command channels.

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: must be: "qcom,wcnss",

- qcom,smd-channel:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: standard SMD property specifying the SMD channel used for
		    communication with the WiFi firmware

= SUBNODES
The subnodes of the wcnss node are optional and describe the individual blocks in
the WCNSS.

== Bluetooth
The following properties are defined to the bluetooth node:

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: must be: "qcom,btqcomsmd"

== WiFi
The following properties are defined to the WiFi node:

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: must be one of:
		    "qcom,wcn3620-wlan",
		    "qcom,wcn3660-wlan",
		    "qcom,wcn3680-wlan"

- qcom,wcnss-mmio:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: should specify base address and size of the WiFi related
		    registers of WCNSS

- interrupts:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: should specify the "rx" and "tx" interrupts

- interrupt-names:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: must contain "rx" and "tx"

- qcom,state:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: should reference the tx-enable and tx-rings-empty SMEM states

- qcom,state-names:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: must contain "tx-enable" and "tx-rings-empty"

= EXAMPLE
The following example represents a SMD node, with one edge representing the
"pronto" subsystem, with the wcnss device and its wcn3680 BT and WiFi blocks
described; as found on the 8974 platform.

smd {
	compatible = "qcom,smd";

	pronto {
		interrupts = <0 142 1>;

		qcom,ipc = <&apcs 8 17>;
		qcom,smd-edge = <6>;

		wcnss {
			compatible = "qcom,wcnss";
			qcom,smd-channels = "WCNSS_CTRL";

			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <1>;

			bt {
				compatible = "qcom,btqcomsmd";
			};

			wifi {
				compatible = "qcom,wcn3680-wlan";

				qcom,wcnss-mmio = <0xfb000000 0x21b000>;

				interrupts = <0 145 0>, <0 146 0>;
				interrupt-names = "tx", "rx";

				qcom,state = <&apps_smsm 10>, <&apps_smsm 9>;
				qcom,state-names = "tx-enable", "tx-rings-empty";
			};
		};
	};
};
