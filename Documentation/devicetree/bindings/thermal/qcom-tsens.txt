* QCOM SoC Temperature Sensor (TSENS)

Required properties:
- compatible :
 - "qcom,msm8916-tsens" : For 8916 Family of SoCs
 - "qcom,msm8974-tsens" : For 8974 Family of SoCs
 - "qcom,msm8960-tsens" : For 8960 Family of SoCs

- reg: Address range of the thermal registers
- qcom,tsens-slopes : Must contain slope value for each of the sensors controlled
			by this device
- #thermal-sensor-cells : Should be 1. See ./thermal.txt for a description.
- Refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/eeprom/eeprom.txt to know how to specify
an eeprom cell

Optional properties:
- qcom,sensor-id: List of sensor instances used in a given SoC. A TSENS IP can
		  have a fixed number of sensors (like 11) but a given SoC can
		  use only 5 of these and they might not always the first 5. They
		  could be sensors 0, 1, 4, 8 and 9. This property is used to
		  describe the subset of the sensors used. If this property is
		  missing they are assumed to be the first 'n' sensors numbered
		  sequentially in which case the number of sensors defaults to
		  the number of slope values.

Example:
tsens: thermal-sensor@900000 {
		compatible = "qcom,msm8916-tsens";
		qcom,tsens-slopes = <1176 1176 1154 1176 1111
				1132 1132 1199 1132 1199
				1132>;
		calib_data = <&tsens_caldata>;
		calib_sel = <&tsens_calsel>;
		qcom,tsens-slopes = <3200 3200 3200 3200 3200>;
		qcom,sensor-id = <0 1 2 4 5>;
		#thermal-sensor-cells = <1>;
	};
